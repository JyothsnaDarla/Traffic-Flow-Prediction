        <h2>Introduction to the Project</h2>
        <p>Our Traffic Flow Prediction project provides users with real-time insights into traffic conditions across various locations. Using a combination of geographical data and natural language processing (NLP), this tool helps users make informed decisions to plan safer and more efficient routes.</p>

        <h2>What Makes Our Project Unique</h2>
        <p>This project stands out by integrating location-based data with text descriptions of traffic conditions to create a comprehensive traffic flow forecast. Whether it’s daily commuting or planning around peak traffic times, our prediction tool offers valuable, location-specific traffic insights that go beyond standard traffic maps.</p>

        <h2>How the Project Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enter Location Details:</strong> Begin by entering a city name, and optionally, a specific street within the city where you’d like to predict traffic flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide a Traffic Description:</strong> Add any known details about the traffic situation (e.g., "morning rush hour" or "road construction") to refine the prediction.</li>
            <li><strong>Receive a Customized Prediction:</strong> Click on "entry," and the system will analyze both the location and text input to provide a prediction on whether traffic is likely to be heavy or smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Show:</strong>Show Traffic Data Page: Users can search for traffic data by entering a location (and optionally a street name). Upon form submission, the application queries the database (or another data source) and displays matching records in a table format. If no data is found, an error message is shown.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Values and Vision</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to make commuting easier by giving users the tools to avoid high-traffic areas and select better routes. Through accurate predictions, we aim to support smarter, safer travel decisions and contribute to reduced congestion.</p>
