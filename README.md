# 🚦 Traffic Flow Prediction App

A Flask-based web application that predicts traffic conditions (Smooth, Moderate, or Heavy) using a combination of **geographical data** and **user-entered traffic descriptions** with **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides users with **real-time insights** into traffic conditions across different locations.  
It combines **geolocation (latitude & longitude)** with **text-based descriptions** (like "road jam due to accident") to deliver accurate traffic predictions.  

It also displays traffic flow on an interactive **Folium map** and stores past predictions in a **SQLite database** for reference.
